## How To Use
1. Run _TinyTunnel.exe_, click _Gen_ button to generate a RSA private key if you don't have any ppk file, upload public key to your remote server, then save private key as a ppk file named _private.ppk_ to the _TinyTunnelTemp_ auto-created folder next to _TinyTunnel.exe_.
2. fill your remote server host name and other fields, click 'Start'.
3. Use a socks proxy tool, like the chrome extension _SwitchyOmega_.

## Why not ShadowSock?
The Great Wall is tougher and tougher to fight with. SSH tunnel is still reliable. So TinyTunnel just offers a choice for you, not best choice, but it works.
